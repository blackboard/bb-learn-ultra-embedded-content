# Common Component library
We have included this helper library to provide common Blackboard design patterns, utilities, localization/accessibility solutions, and styling to build a content provider that blends in with the Blackboard Learn UI.

## How to Include a Component/Module
Simply add an import to the top of a file, ie.
```javascript
import { someUtility } from '/library/utilities'
```
